<h2>About the game</h2>
Color Clash is a fun, competitive spin on the classic Color Switch game — designed for two players to test their reflexes and precision. Each player controls their own colored ball, navigating through spinning obstacles by matching colors. The twist? It’s a race — the firstone to the finish line wins!

The game combines the simple, satisfying mechanics of Color Switch with local multiplayer dynamics, encouraging fast reactions and head-to-head competition. This project showcases input handling for two players, obstacle generation, color-matching logic, scoring, and a clean, colorful UI — all built in Unity.

<h2>🎮 Key Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Local 2-Player Mode: Both players compete side by side on the same screen</li>

<li>Smooth one-tap controls for each player</li>

<li>Rotating, colorful obstacles with random patterns</li>

<li>Color collision system: pass only through matching colors</li>

<li>Win/lose condition and rematch option</li>

<li>Clean minimalist UI showing players’ progress</li>
</ul>

<h2>🚀 Why I Made It</h2>
This project expands the original single-player concept to explore local multiplayer mechanics — from input management to dual player tracking and fair collision detection. It’s a fun way to practice Unity’s input system, physics, and UI flow for competitive gameplay.

<h2>✅ Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add power-ups for extra twists</li>

<li>Multiple levels or obstacle types</li>

<li>Online multiplayer with matchmaking</li>

<li>Animated effects and sound design for extra polish</li>
</ul>
