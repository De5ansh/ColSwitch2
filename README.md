<h2>About the game</h2>
Color Clash is a fun, competitive spin on the classic Color Switch game â€” designed for two players to test their reflexes and precision. Each player controls their own colored ball, navigating through spinning obstacles by matching colors. The twist? Itâ€™s a race â€” the firstone to the finish line wins!

The game combines the simple, satisfying mechanics of Color Switch with local multiplayer dynamics, encouraging fast reactions and head-to-head competition. This project showcases input handling for two players, obstacle generation, color-matching logic, scoring, and a clean, colorful UI â€” all built in Unity.
